# MovesenseMds-iOS

Movesense Device Service (MDS) is an Objective-C API for communicating with Movesense sensors via Bluetooth LE.

This version is packed for distribution via Swift Package Manager and is much smaller download than the CocoaPods one.

The versioning follows Movesense CocoaPod from https://bitbucket.org/movesense/movesense-mobile-lib/src/master/.
